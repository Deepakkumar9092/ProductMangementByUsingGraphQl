The "Product and Order Management" project is a backend application developed with Spring Boot and MySQL as the database,
utilizing GraphQL for efficient data querying and interaction. The project leverages JPA Repository for database communication, 
enabling seamless integration with the MySQL database for CRUD operations. Through GraphQL, it allows for flexible and optimized queries,
providing precise data responses based on client requests. This setup is ideal for managing products, orders, and related data entities,
ensuring efficient, secure, and scalable handling of complex queries in a robust backend system.
